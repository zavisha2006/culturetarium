            Hello!  My name is Zavish. Welcome to Culturetarium!
            In today's society, there is a large amount of disconnect between people around the world, 
            and people with different backgrounds. This problem has improved in the past few decades,
            but it's still a prevalent problem in society. Learning about cultures around the world
            can help introduce people to different peoples' ways of living, can help end the disconnect
            in society, and is an important step to creating peace in the world as well as being able to live 
            among one another in harmony.

            This site was created to help fix this problem -- to teach others about culture in order
            to foster a greater appreciation and understanding of cultures around the world that
            may have a different way of living than people are used to. To learn about a certain cultural
            aspect, simply click randomize, and you will see a short description of a cultural aspect followed
            by a link to read more about the topic. You can submit an idea of a cultural topic by contacting
            me from the contact section of this website.

            Let's learn cultures!
